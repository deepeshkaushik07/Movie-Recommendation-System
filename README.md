# Movie-Recommendation-System

A Python-based movie recommendation system utilizing machine learning techniques like content-based filtering. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand and visualize the data before building the recommendation model.

# Key Highlights

Data-Driven Insights: Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides a deep understanding of the movie dataset, uncovering patterns and trends.

Content-Based Recommendations: Uses advanced similarity metrics to suggest movies based on content features like genres and keywords.

Model Efficiency: Optimized for quick and accurate recommendations by leveraging vectorization and other efficient data processing techniques.

Similarity Matching: Advanced similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) powered by scikit-learn and difflib enable accurate movie recommendations.

Python Ecosystem: Built with powerful Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and difflib to ensure efficient data processing and model building.

Scalability: The system is designed to be easily extendable, allowing integration with other recommendation techniques like collaborative filtering.

Customizable: Flexibility to modify the dataset and tweak similarity algorithms for tailored recommendations.
